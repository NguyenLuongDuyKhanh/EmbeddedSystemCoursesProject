# Embedded System Courses

We have to work on a project to measure temperate and hump of a bow of tree, then push them to the server for easy to check any time, any where

We have 2 part of this project:
* Server
* Measurement (using MSP430G2553 and ...)
* Wifi solution for the measurement (ESP8266)

## Server

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
