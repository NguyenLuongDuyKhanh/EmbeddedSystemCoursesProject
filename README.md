# Embedded System Courses

We have to work on a project to measure temperate and hump of a bow of tree, then push them to the server for easy to check any time, any where

We have 2 part of this project:
* Server
* Measurement (using MSP430G2553 and ...)
* Wifi solution for the measurement (ESP8266)

## Server

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
## Measurement
=============
## Wifi Solution

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
