This is the first commit of this project.
For few day ago, i make something in our project:
- I took a look into manufactual of EXPG2 base on MSP430G2553 microcontroler - which hardware solution a have - and try to programing by driver libary. But the driver lib does not support for this version (MSP430G2xx) because they though it is not too hard to programming in this board using 'register type' (but i don't think so) so they was not contruct a lib for this board. So, we must coding with 'register type'.
- Then, i trying to use Azue Virtual machine but have not got result yet... Im trying my best...
